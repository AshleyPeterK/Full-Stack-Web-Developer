Design decisions:

What things were done to implement this Hangman game API using the 'Guess A number' Project 
that was provided to serve as guide in this project:

- Modified the cron.yaml and main.py files to send Email every 12 hours to only users with a score of  zero.

- Altered the number of attempts /guesses to guess a word from 5 to 7 in the 'Game' model 
  to make the game easier to win and hence encourage users to play the game more often.

- A user can only guess one letter at time and not an entire word. I did this because allowing a user   to input a whole word would make the game logic harder to implement as it would require more    complex code to implement.

- Decided to only implement guessing a single word as guessing a phrase would make the game logic much harder to implement.
