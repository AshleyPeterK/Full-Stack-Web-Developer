##Projects that were done to finish this Nanodegree

- **Project 2 - Tournament Results**
  - You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.
- **Project 3 - Item Catalog**
  - You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.
