##Projects that were done to finish this Nanodegree
- **Project 1 - Movie Trailer Website**
  - You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.
- **Project 2 - Tournament Results**
  - You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.
- **Project 3 - Item Catalog**
  - You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.
- **Project 4 - Design A Game API**
  - In this project you will use these skills to develop your own game! You will write an API with endpoints that will allow anyone to develop a front-end for your game. Since you aren't required to write a front-end you can use API explorer to test your API.
- **Project 5 - Linux Server Configuration**
  - You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.
